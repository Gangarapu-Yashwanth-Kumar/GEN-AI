# GEN AI

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating **Generative AI** workflows:

- **Image Generation Without API Key** – building and running an image generation model locally.
- **Interacting with CLIP** – exploring OpenAI’s CLIP model for text–image understanding.
---

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is a hands-on resource for learning **Generative AI** techniques without relying on paid APIs and for experimenting with **CLIP** (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining).  
It’s ideal for students, researchers, and developers interested in practical implementations of cutting-edge AI.

## ✨ Key Features  

### 🖼️ Image Generation Without API Key (Notebook 1)

🚀 Created a **local text-to-image generation workflow** using **VQGAN / Diffusion Models**.  
Enhanced image synthesis with:  
✅ 📝 Custom **prompt engineering** to steer outputs  
✅ ⚙️ **Guidance-scale tuning** for sharper, more relevant images  
✅ ⏱️ **Inference-step control** for speed/quality trade-off  

🤝 Added **CLIP-based similarity scoring** to evaluate or refine generated images.  
💻 Runs **fully offline without API keys**, enabling cost-efficient experimentation.  
🎨 Demonstrates **synthetic data augmentation** and **creative design pipelines**.

### 🔹 Interacting with CLIP (Notebook 2)

🔍 Explored **OpenAI CLIP** for **vision-language understanding**:  
✅ 🖼️ **Zero-shot image classification** directly from text prompts  
✅ 🔄 **Cross-modal retrieval** (search images by text & vice versa)  
✅ 📊 **Text–image embedding similarity** for ranking and clustering  

⚡ Built combined **Transformer text encoder + CNN/ViT image encoder** pipelines.  
🗺️ Provided **cosine-similarity heatmaps** and **embedding-space visualisations** to interpret results.
