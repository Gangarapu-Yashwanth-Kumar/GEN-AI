# GEN AI

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating **Generative AI** workflows:
- **Interacting with CLIP** – exploring OpenAI’s CLIP model for text–image understanding.
- **Image Generation Without API Key** – building and running an image generation model locally.

---

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is a hands-on resource for learning **Generative AI** techniques without relying on paid APIs and for experimenting with **CLIP** (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining).  
It’s ideal for students, researchers, and developers interested in practical implementations of cutting-edge AI.

## ✨ Key Features  

### 🔹 Interacting with CLIP (Notebook 1)
- ✅ Uses **OpenAI CLIP** for **vision–language understanding**.  
- ✅ Performs **zero-shot image classification**.  
- ✅ Computes **text–image similarity embeddings** for cross-modal retrieval.  
- ✅ Generates **cosine similarity visualizations / heatmaps** to interpret results.  

### 🔹 Image Generation Without API Key (Notebook 2)
- ✅ Builds a **text-to-image generation pipeline** with **VQGAN / Diffusion Models**.  
- ✅ Integrates **CLIP-based similarity** to refine or evaluate generated images.  
- ✅ Implements **prompt engineering** and **guidance scale tuning** for optimized output.  
- ✅ Enables **offline deployment without API dependencies** for cost-efficient experimentation.  
- ✅ Demonstrates **synthetic data augmentation & creative design workflows**.
